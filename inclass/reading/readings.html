<h1>Reading Response</h1>
<h2>Olia Lialina – A Vernacular Web</h2>
<p>"There was a pre-existing environment; a structural, visual and acoustic culture you could play around with, a culture you could break. There was a world of options and one of the options was to be different". I really liked this quote from the beginning. There's something very cute and charming about the history of the "under construction", there's someone still working on it, trying to improve before it's ready to be seen. I thought it was funny reading about the "starry night background" because I unintentionally did this in my Interaction website last semester. I thought the history of the MIDI was really fascinating. I found it really interesting how it wasn't just a recorded sound but through MIDI a song was played like coded music. I like how she talks about how professional websites really changed website design but also later on talks about how the homepage has become a sign of humanity against these professional websites of big companies, they can be a sign that the site is made out of passion and love.

<h2>My website is… - Laurel Schwulst</h2>
<p>“In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you.” I really liked this quote.
“Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future… This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.”
In today’s age of the internet being controlled by money hungry corporations it's our jobs as artists to make our own websites and breath some creativity and humanity into the web, something that's been lost since its birth (think of all the silly little fansites, animal pages, back when people made them just for fun). It’s interesting to think now that these big corporations now capitalize off this idea (Instagram, Twitter, etc) I know I definitely had fan pages but people used to make their own. I love the analogy of a website like a room and all the different ways you can use them. Websites our like our internet homes, how we furnish, what we do with them, it’s a reflection of ourselves to the world or the image we create (which goes hand in hand with today's social media culture).

<h2>American Artist – Black Gooey Universe</h2>
<p>The history of Silicon Valley is interesting but sadly not that shocking. This is yet another reminder of the importance of “de-colonizng” design today. It’s interesting to think, and ditto to James, what tech today may be like if it was originally designed from a more diverse team.
</p>
<h2>James Goggin – The Matta-Clark Complex </h2>
<p>There was a lot of good information in this and I feel like I definitely need to remember this to come back to later. “With particular artists, one risks reducing to parody the very content of the book, or even blurring lines between 'the work' and 'the document'. The book should subjectively communicate the work in a sympathetic way, but not attempt to be the work, or risk being mistaken as such”. The history of typography on the web was really interesting to learn about, also interesting how printing had an impact on this as well.

<h2>Mindy Seu - Cyberfeminism Index</h2>
<p>I think Mindy’s project is so awesome. It’s so important to document the web history, and in an industry that’s largely male dominated it’s so cool to see this site highlight women’s contributions and amazing projects that have made the web into what it is today. I like how Mindy still calls out some modern issues, where lots of these contributions are from a smaller group of women, and many who are white. I think it’s important to make sure the content we have access to is from all kinds of different viewpoints so what we’re seeing isn’t just one POV.  I also found it interesting how she talked about the carbon footprint of the web. Every email, text, etc has some sort of effect and we over look that alot. How can we make the web more green? Solar panel powered data servers? It’s a lot to think about, but green energy will be crucial for the webs future and our lives.

<h2>Spirit Surfing</h2>
<p>Interesting way of looking at the web, patterns and patterns. Nastynets uses standard blog structure, collective use of users uses it to collect things from the internet and shows them. About noticing patterns. Collecting on the internet can be an artistic act, collective and result. The way you frame things and present them makes a difference and affects perception of the collection. Juxtaposition.

<h2>Can the Internet be archived? - Jill Lepore</h2>
<p>Before reading this, I was under the assumption that the internet would archive anything forever. People always say to be caution of what your post because it’s there forever, but this article brings up how easily this can be rebutted when the host of many sites just shut down (ex. Myspace) and taking all content with it. I think it’s funny though to imagine our tweets being stored in the Library of Congress. The Wayback machine is such an anomaly to me, it can’t fully comprehend how it functions but I think it’s important to archive the web’s history. I decided to play around with it because the first thing I thought of in the instance of internet archiving was the disney princess website. I remember it being such a magical experience as a child going on my parents computer to log onto the website and I was dying to experience that once again 15 years later. On the site, it was very broken, but seeing the homepage gave me a rush of nostalgia. But still this is what the article was talking about, I am viewing the homepage but the site is completely broken. I’m unlikely to be able to experience the site back in 2007 like it was ever again.
