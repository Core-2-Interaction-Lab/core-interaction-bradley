        <h2> What you need </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Trader Joe's Vegan Orange Chicken<li>
            <li> Jasmine White Rice <li>
            <li> Red Pepper Flakes <li>
            <li> Sesame Oil <li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Step 1 </h2>
        <p> Start by preparing the rice. Measure out how much rice you want. For my rice cooker I usually do a cup and a half. Wash your rice! (Please) Then put it in the rice cooker and start. </p>
        <br>
        <h2> Step 2 </h2>
        <p> Start with your pan on medium heat. Pour a fair amount of Sesame oil onto the pan, but not too much. Like a tablespoon? After the oil is warmed, add your "chicken". Let it cook for two to three minutes until golden, then flip to the other side. After they're golden on each side, add in your sauce packet. Sprinkle in some red pepper flakes, mix it up and let it cook until the sauce thickens. <p>
            <br>
        <h2> Step 3 </h2>
        <p> Put your rice in a bowl, and then add your chicken to the bowl and you're done! </p>
