		<p>This is a site dedicated to my Mom. She recently passed away and when going through some of her things I found this collection hidden away in some boxes in our attic. I love this collection of stickers, I think theyâ€™re so fun and I can see my Mom had great taste. I hope I can continue this collection so one day my kids can inherit it. </p>
