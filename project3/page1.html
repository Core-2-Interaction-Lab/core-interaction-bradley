					<br> <br> 
					<b> Dear Neighbor,</b> 
					<br> <br> 
					Over the past few months the noise from your apartment has been very disruptive. It is absolutely essential that all residents respect the right to quiet enjoyment of their neighbors. A right that is protected by law and by the covenants of your lease. 
					I please ask that you respect the concerns of your neighbors and control your noise levels generated within your rented premises. I hope you know if you do not do so, you will be in violation of your lease, and with local law.<br> <br>
					<a href="page2.html">But more importantly, you will be disrupting the quiet enjoyment of your neighbors...</a></h1>
